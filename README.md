### 🧢 **FashionStyleSwap AI** - Virtual Outfit Swapper and Stylist

#### 📝 Project Description:

"FashionStyleSwap AI" is an AI-powered virtual stylist that allows users to upload a photo of themselves and a reference outfit. The system swaps the outfit virtually, recommends complementary accessories, and generates a style caption with hashtags for social sharing.

---

### 💡 Key Features:

1. **Virtual Outfit Swapper** – Upload a personal image and an outfit image. The app merges them using basic overlay for a demo (advanced GAN integration can be added).
2. **Accessory Recommender** – Based on outfit type (e.g., formal, casual), it suggests accessories (shoes, bags, watches).
3. **Style Caption Generator** – Uses a local LLM (Ollama/TinyLLaMA) or prompt-based template to create a social post.
4. **Image Enhancement (New Feature)** – Enhances the uploaded fashion image using OpenCV for clearer overlays.
5. **Download Styled Output (New Feature)** – Download the final stylized image and post content.
